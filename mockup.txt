Why I love to code;
IÂ´ve interested in computers and programming ever since i saw a computer open in computer lab back when I was in 5th grade, I remember at the time thinking: "How can this mess of wires and green boards show moving pictures and let me play super mario during class?".
Through the following years computers became my hobby, I used my free time learning to build computers and write some small bits of code on my free time by searching tutorials on the internet.
My first experiences programming where using the Java language to write some basic console based programs, and later learned to use the integrated Swing library to make a small game that im still proud of to this day, I mean, who in their right mind would use java swing for anything these days?

By the time i was in higschool i was used to making small programs for anything that came to mind, like automating my math and physics homeworks, or trying to make games on unity with my friends a longside helping friends build their PCs and pick parts for the fun of it, or to make a quick buck here and there.

After highschool i chose a carreer in electrical engineering
